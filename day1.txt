	Java Standard Edition
	
	Java Features
	--------------
	1. Simple 
		no need to know the h/w (hardware details) 
		no pointers 
		no memory management

	2. WORA
		- write once run anywhere
		platform neutral

	3. Multithreaded

		
	4. Robust
		- excpetion handling - ability to handle runtime errors
		- automatic garbage collection

	5. Distributed
		- write programs for the network
			programA on  machine1
			other programB on another machine2

			and programA and programB can communicate
			with each other over the network

	6. Object Oriented
		KEY FEATURE
		(all our 60 hours are around this feature)

		What is an object?

		
		Object = physical state + behaviour
			 ( data )       + functionality


		cat  = color, age   +  sleeping()
			weight		snoozing()
			breed		drinkMilk()
					chaseMice()



		account = ac_type, ac_no + withdraw()
			  ac_balance	   deposit()
			  ac_holder_name   transfer()
			  acholder_phone   getbalance()
			  		   printStatement()

	3 read the code
	
	4 write the code


Your First Java Code
----------------------

the code name can be any name
extension would be .java

The fundamental unit of JAVA programming is a class







STEP I : write your code

First.java
-----------
1 public class First
2 { 
3	public static void main(String args[])
4	{
5		System.out.println("Hello everyone");
6	}  
7 } 

line number 3 is a ready made line known to JAVA

STEP II : compile your code

	javac First.java
	|
	it will generate one code known as
	|
	First.class

STEP III : run your code

	java First
